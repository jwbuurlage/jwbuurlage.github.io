> In 2018, I hosted a weekly meetup on functional programming with a focus on category theory. In this blog post series I revisit [the notes I wrote back then](https://github.com/jwbuurlage/category-theory-programmers), aiming to simplify where possible, and to extend and fix where needed. I also try to implement the examples in Scala rather than Haskell.
