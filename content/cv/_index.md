## Professional experience

### **Microsoft**. Senior Research Software Engineer
#### _Zurich, Switzerland (2020 - present)_

- Applied expertise in **large-scale distributed systems** and
  **high-performance computing** to develop a cloud-based mapping and
localization service for mixed reality devices.
- Contributed to the development of a complex, **asynchronous**,
  **distributed**, and **incremental** computer-vision based mapping pipeline
using **C++ microservices** deployed on a **Kubernetes cluster**.
- Designed and implemented **gRPC services** for **real-time localization** of
  mixed reality devices, and optimized **I/O** and **cache efficiency** using
various **graph algorithms**.
- Conducted a research project on **distributed optimization**, jointly optimizing
  camera poses and observed landmarks, and developed **data partitioning**
techniques to minimize communication between nodes, resulting in a **patent
application submission**.
- Led the implementation of the **observability stack** for the mapping pipeline,
  which included emitting and processing **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces** to set up **dashboards**, **monitors**, and **on-call integration**.
- Developed a **web-based 3D viewer** for quantitative and qualitative inspection
  of reconstructed maps, available sensor data, and localization performance,
among other metrics.

### **Google**. Software Engineering Intern PhD
#### _Sunnyvale, CA, United States (2019)_

- Contributed to the Google Infrastructure Configuration Service team to develop a hybrid storage backend for the Global Service Load Balancer, utilizing and developing knowledge of **distributed systems**.
- Implemented a **real-time update system** for a distributed configuration store and used a **reliable message queue** to periodically commit the current state to a version-controlled repository, enabling easy rollbacks.

### **CWI**. PhD Research Scientist
#### _Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2016 - 2020)_

- Developed **Bulk**, an open-source C++ library for **bulk-synchronous parallel
algorithms**, showcasing proficiency in developing and implementing parallel algorithms for distributed systems.
- Developed novel partitioning schemes for **distributed tomographic reconstruction** using computational geometry, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving efficiency. Implemented these schemes for CT reconstruction on multiple nodes each with multiple GPUs. The method had much lower runtime compared to the state of the art.
- Devised a distributed system for **real-time tomographic reconstruction** that efficiently reconstructs arbitrary slices through a 3D volume. This allows for a live view of one or more arbitrary cross sections of a dynamic object, which had never been done before. Communication occurs between the X-ray detector, control nodes, GPUs, and a workstation for visualization.

### **Buurlage Wits**. Co-founder / Software engineer
#### _Utrecht, The Netherlands (2014 - 2016)_

- Developed framework for streaming and **parallel algorithms** on many-core
  processors. 
- **Data science** projects for a major Dutch newsletter (nrc.next) and one of the
  largest Dutch non-profits (KWF).
